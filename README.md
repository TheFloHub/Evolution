# Evolution

#Ideas:


- split traits into behaviours (movement, eating, etc ..) and needs (calories, water .. oxygen?)
- change behaviour for movement, 1. drink 2. food 3. reproduce (takes time, instead of probability, add reproductionTime)


- add temperature (most influenced by height)
- add water
- (add wind?)

- start adding predators (only by mutating size)?
- start adding fauna

- play with sensor range, size seperately to find an equilibrium
- add mutation speed 0 - 100% which means speed = range from speed*0.9 - speed  * 1.1

# Level designs / goals
- put two population in separate areas, let them evolve and then remove the barrier
- player has control over mutation speed
- besides the start player can only control sliders and maybe terrain but never control behaviours

- own level editor where you can make a scenario and write a descriptions how to achieve it and must reach the goal to upload it, like portal2

- events like meteor or d√ºrre
- or seasons like winter where food is only 50% or so

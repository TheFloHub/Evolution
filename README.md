# Evolution

#Ideas:
- split traits into behaviours (movement, eating, etc ..) and needs (calories, water .. oxygen?)
- add temperature (most influenced by height)
- add water
- (add wind?)

- start adding predators (only by mutating size)?
- start adding fauna

- play with sensor range, size seperately to find an equilibrium
- add mutation speed 0 - 100% which means speed = range from speed*0.9 - speed  * 1.1
